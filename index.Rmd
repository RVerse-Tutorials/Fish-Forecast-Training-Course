# Course Description

This short course will be divided into a morning session on creating forecasting models for catch data and an afternoon session on Report-writing and Code documentation with R.

The course will consist of short lectures and many practical labs where you will work with R to model data and prepare forecasts.  You are encouraged to bring your own time-series data, for example yearly or monthly catch or count data, so that you can begin to model it during the course.

In the afternoon, you will learn to write reports and websites with R and R Markdown so that you can easily share your work and document your work.  You will learn how to easily prepare online books, reports and websites that integrate R and text.
